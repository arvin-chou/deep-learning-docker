# How to use
### step 1. run a predict script which write result files
You should write your own predict script and define your own format
For instance:
- CSV format
    ```
    image_id,class_id,confidence,xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax
    1,1,0.9,2,3,387,556
    ```
### step 2. run a eval script which read ground truth and predict result files to compare the diff and output benchmark results
In this step, you need to write your own parser transforming

1. the format of result file generated by step1 
2. the format of ground truth file

to the data format defined in bounding_box.py

Then, run `python3 eval.py`
